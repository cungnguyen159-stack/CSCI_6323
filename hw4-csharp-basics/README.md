# HW4: C# Language Basics

**Student Name**: Doan Thien Cung Nguyen
**Course**: CSCI 6323 - Server Web Development
**Semester**: Spring 2026

## Exercises Completed

- [x] Exercise 1: Hello C# ✓
- [x] Exercise 2: Types and Variables ✓
- [x] Exercise 3: Collections and LINQ ✓
- [x] Exercise 4: Classes and Objects ✓
- [x] Exercise 5: Async Programming ✓

## How to Run

Each exercise is a separate console application. To run:

```bash
cd Exercise1
dotnet run

cd ../Exercise2
dotnet run

cd ../Exercise3
dotnet run

cd ../Exercise4
dotnet run

cd ../Exercise5
dotnet run
```

## Key Learnings

I learned the basic structure of a C# console application. I understood how static typing works and how it is different from JavaScript. I also understood how async and await work for handling asynchronous operations.

## Challenges

One challenge was understanding static typing and type conversions. At first, I made errors when assigning different data types. I solved this problem by reading error messages carefully and testing again.

## Comparison: JavaScript vs C#

JavaScript uses dynamic typing, but C# uses static typing. In C#, the compiler checks types before running the program, which helps reduce runtime errors. C# code feels more strict and structured than JavaScript. LINQ in C# is similar to JavaScript array methods like filter, map, and reduce.
